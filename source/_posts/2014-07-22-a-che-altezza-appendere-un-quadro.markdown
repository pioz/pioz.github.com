To hang pictures I like use the _midline_ style. Basically you draw an imaginary
line on the wall that's up to 5/8 of the height of the wall itself. Then the
pictires are hung with 3/8 of their height above the midline.

So the formula to calculate the height to hang a picture is:

    h = (H*5 + q*3) / 8

where `H` is the height of the wall where you want hang the picture and `q` is
the height of the picture itself.
